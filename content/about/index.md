# Introduction

Hello!, I'm Joohwan Park, a skilled software engineer student at Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, South Korea.  I have a strong interest in blockchain development and exploring its potential to revolutionize various industries.  


I have worked on an 1 year Django website project for a Book Recommendation System based on User Behavior History and Content Analysis using AI. 
I had the opportunity to work as an intern for a period of two months to further develop this project as an fast api server.


I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies, including blockchain , AI and Web development.
